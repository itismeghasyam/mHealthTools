\title{Given a processed time series find its period using autocorrelation
and then convert it to heart rate (bpm)}
\usage{
get_hr_from_time_series(x, sampling_rate, method = "acf", min_hr = 45,
  max_hr = 210)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A time series numeric data}

\item{sampling_rate}{The sampling rate (fs) of the time series data}

\item{method}{The algorithm used to estimate the heartrate, because the
preprocessing steps are different for each. method can be any of 
'acf','psd' or 'peak' for algorithms based on autocorrelation, 
power spectral density and peak picking respectively}

\item{min_hr}{Minimum expected heart rate}

\item{max_hr}{Maximum expected heart rate}
}
\value{
A named vector containing heart rate and the confidence of the result
}
